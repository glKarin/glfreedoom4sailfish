prboom (2:2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency set to high as it fixes a release-critical bug
  * Revert to the 2.2 branch. Despite all testing efforts 2.3 turned
    out to be too buggy for release with Sarge:
    - Fix savegames (Closes: #266874)
    - Dynamic loading of the GL modules has been a feature of the
      2.3 branch. To prevent sharp performance drops on systems without
      3D accelleration build without GL support for Sarge, as the GL
      mode is still far from bugfree. Later version will have a
      separate binary package for a GL enabled build.
    - Fix weapon selection (Closes: #270110)
    - Fix the unusable menus on powerpc.
  * Move to main, now that freedoom is available in the archive.
