prboom was debianized by Arthur Korn <arthur@korn.ch> on Mon, 13 Nov 2000
19:22:11 +0100. Maintenance from 2.2.3 to 2.2.6 was by Moritz Muehlenhoff
<jmm@inutil.org>, with review and sponsorship by Emanuele Rocca
<ema@debian.org>. Maintenance from 2.4.5 to present by Jon Dowland
<jon@alcopop.org> and the Debian Games Team.

prboom was downloaded from <http://prboom.sourceforge.net/linux.html>

The version of prboom distributed in Debian differs from upstream in the
following ways:

    * support for helper dogs is disabled and the helper dog
      resources are removed. This is because they are taken
      from Wolfenstein 3D (c) ID Software, all rights
      reserved.

    * Various menu graphics have been substituted as the originals
      are derived from menu graphics taken from Doom or Doom 2, both
      (c) ID Software and all rights reserved. The list of lumps
      replaced can be found in the file bad_menu_lumps.txt.

An upstream tarball can be modified with these changes using the script
"fix_upstream.sh" in the ./debian directory in the source package.
